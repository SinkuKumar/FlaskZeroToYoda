# Flask Zero To Yoda

This repository contains code for developing REST API in Flask from absolute beginner to the master level.

Credit goes the [Creator](https://dev.to/paurakhsharma/flask-rest-api-part-0-setup-basic-crud-api-4650)

This is not to be considered as reproduction of the tutorial, neither this is a tutorial. This is just to follow the instructions to learn the fundamentals with the management of code using GitHub.

- As the tutorial is divided into 7 parts, I'm using 7 different branches for maintaining the code.
- Also, I'm using SQLite DB instead of MongoDB as given in the tutorial. This is just my decision as I'm aware and comfortable in SQLite. I'm not considering anything related to the performance or any technical measurement. Just a preference.
- Further changes will be updated in the README

## Part 0: Setup and Basic CRUD API
* In this part basic setup and a CRUD API is made using built-in list and dictionary.
* Movies data is used as dummy data, it supports CRUD operation.
